 <p> Copyright is very important to the works of many talented writers, musicians, etc. Without copyright, many classic novels such as Alice
 in Wonderland, Sleeping Beauty, and Captain Nemo would have never been able to be as big as they are today. However though, copyright laws aren't 
 treated fairly when it cones to the termination of it. When Mickey Mouse was nearly entering the public domain, Disney resigned for more years of 
 copyright (?) and somehow extended for another 70. After this, nearly nothing has entered the public domain for years. Both copyright laws, and respecting
 them are equally as important as most laws out there. </p>
